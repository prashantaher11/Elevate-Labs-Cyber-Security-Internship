‚ö†Ô∏è Technical Indicators of Spoofing
Evidence	Explanation
‚ùå No SPF/DKIM/DMARC Results Visible	These are missing or not validated, which weakens domain authentication. A legitimate bank would have SPF/DKIM/DMARC configured.
‚ùå Domain secure-login.com is unverified	The sending domain is not recognized as YourBank‚Äôs domain, likely registered for phishing.
‚ùì No IP Origin Info	Header lacks server/IP info for traceability ‚Äî a suspicious omission.
‚úÖ Header Found	Only basic header fields were captured, which is common when spoofers avoid detection by manipulating header formatting.
