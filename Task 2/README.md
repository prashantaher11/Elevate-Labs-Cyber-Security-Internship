| 3 | **Urgency & Threat**   | Mentions "verify within 24 hours" to cause panic and trick user. |
| 4 | **Phishing Button**    | “Verify Your Account” button likely redirects to a phishing website. |

###  Technical Indicators of Spoofing

| Evidence | Explanation |
|----------|-------------|
|  **No SPF/DKIM/DMARC Results** | Email lacks authentication — likely spoofed. |
|  **Unverified Domain**         | `secure-login.com` is not owned by YourBank. |
|  **No IP Origin Info**         | Missing details prevent traceability. |
|  **Header Present**            | Basic headers found, but spoofers often manipulate them. |
