## 1. Steps Taken

### Step 1 – Opening the Extensions Page
- For Google Chrome: Navigated to `chrome://extensions/`.
- This displayed all installed browser extensions.

### Step 2 – Reviewing Installed Extensions
- Checked the name and description of each extension.
- Verified whether I remembered installing it and if it served a clear purpose.

### Step 3 – Checking Permissions & Reviews
- Opened the **Details** page for each extension.
- Looked at the permissions requested (e.g., *"Read and change all your data on websites you visit"*).
- Searched for online reviews to check if the extension had been flagged as unsafe.

### Step 4 – Identifying Suspicious Extensions
Suspicious criteria included:
- Not remembering installing the extension.
- Poor or no reviews in the Chrome Web Store.
- Requests for excessive permissions unrelated to its function.
- Reports of security issues from other users.

### Step 5 – Removing the Extensions
- Clicked **Remove** on suspicious or unused extensions.
- Confirmed removal in the pop-up prompt.

### Step 6 – Restarting the Browser
