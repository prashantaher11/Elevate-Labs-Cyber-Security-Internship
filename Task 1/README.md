## 2️⃣ Potential Security Risks from Open Ports

| **Port** | **Service**       | **Potential Security Risk**                                                                 |
|----------|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 135/tcp  | MSRPC            | Susceptible to DCOM attacks; known target of malware like WannaCry.                         |
| 139/tcp  | NetBIOS-SSN      | Can be exploited for SMB relay attacks and information disclosure.                          |
| 445/tcp  | Microsoft-DS     | Vulnerable to EternalBlue, ransomware attacks; commonly abused in SMB vulnerabilities.      |
| 902/tcp  | ISS RealSecure   | Often VMware-related; may allow unauthorized VM control if unsecured.                       |
| 912/tcp  | Apex Mesh        | Uncommon; may represent custom or misconfigured services, often lacking authentication.     |
| 3306/tcp | MySQL            | Can lead to full DB compromise if weak credentials or open access from untrusted networks.  |
