## 1. VPN Installation & Setup
1. Chose **ProtonVPN** (Free Tier).

## 2. IP Address Change Verification
To confirm that the VPN was working, I checked my IP address before and after connecting.

**Before VPN Connection (Mumbai, India):**

**After VPN Connection (Los Angeles, USA):**

The change in IP location from **Mumbai, India** to **Los Angeles, USA** confirms that the VPN successfully masked my real IP address.

## 3. Confirming Encrypted Traffic
- Browsed websites using **HTTPS** (lock symbol in the address bar), ensuring the traffic between my browser and the website is encrypted.
- With VPN active, all traffic is additionally encrypted and tunneled through the VPN server, preventing ISP or public Wi-Fi providers from viewing my activity.

## 4. Suspicious Browser Extension Removal
- Opened the extensions settings page in my browser.
- Checked for any unrecognized or unnecessary extensions.
- Removed one that was unfamiliar to ensure better privacy.

## 6. Key Concepts Learned
- **VPN (Virtual Private Network):** A tool that encrypts internet traffic and routes it through a remote server.
- **Encryption:** Secures the data so unauthorized parties can’t read it.
- **Tunneling Protocols:** Methods like WireGuard, OpenVPN, etc., used to establish a secure VPN tunnel.
- **Privacy:** VPNs help mask identity online.
- **Network Security:** Adds a layer of protection against cyber threats.
